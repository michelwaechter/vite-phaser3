# Vue 3 + Vite + Phaser 3 :partying_face:

#### viteJS boilerplate that integrates Phaser 3 with Vue 3 project.

Project has been set up with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/). It uses [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) as a game engine.

Acutally, you can use Phaser 3 with Vue 3 without any problems. But, if you want to implement more than one game in an instance, this is not possible. But we will change this. :disguised_face:
